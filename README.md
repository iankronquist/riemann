=======

A Haskell implementation of the Zeta language, or at least its parser.

Because C is, "Unmaintanable devil spawn".

Also, it is useful to develop two parallel implementations of a language, such
as Google Go and GCC Go. This ensures that the language itself is formally
defined and not too closely tied to its implementation.
